      <h3>One Month Weight Loss Plan - Health</h3>
      <p>If you're looking to change up your daily routine to include time for exercise and healthier meals, we have some good news. Implementing even small everyday diet and exercise changes can lead to a long-term difference, says Lee Goldman, MD, executive vice president and dean of the faculties of health sciences and medicine at Columbia University Medical Center.  "the simple message is to stay active," he says. Focus on building activity into your daily routine, he adds, whether it's going to the gym, walking several extra blocks rather than driving, or taking the stairs instead of the elevator. Dr. Goldman also cautions against the common mistake of celebrating your new exercise routine with heartier meals. </p>

      <h3>The Ketogenic Diet: A Detailed Beginner's Guide to Keto
</h3>
      <p>The ketogenic diet is a very low-carb, high-fat diet that shares many similarities with the Atkins and low-carb diets.

It involves drastically reducing carbohydrate intake and replacing it with fat. This reduction in carbs puts your body into a metabolic state called ketosis.

When this happens, your body becomes incredibly efficient at burning fat for energy. It also turns fat into ketones in the liver, which can supply energy for the brain </p>

      <h3>5 Leg Workouts For Mass - A Beginner's Guide!</h3>
      <p>If this is an article about building legs, why am I talking to you about symmetry? I'm getting there. I brought up symmetry because too many beginners skip out on leg-training (or just do a half-ass job of it) and build a horrible imbalance between the size of their upper and lower body. This completely throws off the symmetry of one's physique. There is nothing more ridiculous than to see a guy in the gym with a well-developed upper body with toothpick legs.
